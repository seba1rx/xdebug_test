## Trying to get XDEBUG running from vscode

The goal of this container is to be able to test the required configuration and required files in order to use xdebug

There are two ways I am trying to use xdebug here:

1: run the container and in vscode test if xdebug works [SUCCESS]

2: run the container and after starting vscode in this same directory, reopen the directory in WSL, then test if xdebug works [SUCCESS]
